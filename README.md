I'm a software engineer with more than 3 years of experience and Computer
Science student at Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL). During my spare
time, I have made sporadic contributions to open-source developer tools, such
as telescope.nvim (fuzzy finder written in Lua for the Neovim text editor) and
quick-lint-js (a JavaScript linter written in C++), contributing to tools like
these make me excited, as I know they can positively impact other developers.

Here is some relevant information about me:

- Experience as a back-end developer with Python, Go and other technologies,
  and as a cross-platform mobile app developer with Flutter.

- Skills in several programming languages, including Python, Typescript
  (NodeJS), Java, Dart, Rust and Go. Thanks to my problem-solving skills, I
  have great ease and flexibility in switching between programming languages
  and frameworks according to the task's requirements.

- Computer Science student at UFAL, with a strong interest in analysis and
  performance of algorithms, compilers and software architecture.

- Fluent in conversational English and with advanced writing skills.

- Ability to learn new concepts and technologies easily.

- Passionate about solving complex problems and creating efficient solutions.
