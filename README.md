time, I have made sporadic contributions to open-source developer tools, such
as telescope.nvim (fuzzy finder for the Neovim text editor written in Lua) and
quick-lint-js (a JavaScript linter written in C++). I also like to build
personal project in many different programming languages, especially tools for
automating daily boring tasks.
