## About me

I'm a ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· brazilian software engineer with more than 3 years of experience and
Computer Science student at Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL).

I work as a mobile and back-end developer at Otimize, a brazilian startup pioneer
in technologies for 3D evaluation of human movement kinematics. 

During my spare time, I have made sporadic contributions to open-source
developer tools, such as

finder for the Neovim text editor written in Lua) and
[quick-lint-js](https://github.com/quick-lint/quick-lint-js) (a JavaScript
linter written in C++).

I also like to build personal project in many different programming languages,
especially tools for automating daily boring tasks.
