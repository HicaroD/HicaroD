## About me

I'm a ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· brazilian software engineer with more than 3 years of experience and
Computer Science student at Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL).

More especifically, I am a mobile and backend developer. I am currently
working at Otimize, a Brazilian startup that is pioneering the use of
technology to evaluate human movement kinematics.

I also love compilers. My main personal project is a compiler for my own
programming language called "idk". This compiler is being written in Rust with
hand-written lexical, syntactic, and semantic algorithms. Currently, I'm
planning to use LLVM to build the backend in order to produce fast and
optimized code for several platforms. About the language's syntax, I got
inspiration from other languages, such as Python, Rust, Go, and Odin. Soon it
will be open-source so I can **hopefully** receive help from more experienced
compiler developers on the Internet.

During my spare time, I have made sporadic contributions to open-source
developer tools, such as
[telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) (fuzzy
finder for the Neovim text editor written in Lua) and
[quick-lint-js](https://github.com/quick-lint/quick-lint-js) (a JavaScript
linter written in C++).

## Skills

- Experience as a back-end developer with Python, Go and other technologies,
  and as a cross-platform mobile app developer with Flutter.

- Skills in several programming languages, including Python, Typescript
  (NodeJS), Java, Dart, Rust and Go. Thanks to my problem-solving skills, I
  have great ease and flexibility in switching between programming languages
  and frameworks according to the task's requirements.

- Fluent in conversational English and with advanced writing skills. I'm
  [EC2 Proficient in the EF Standard English Test](https://www.efset.org/cert/gpUeom)

- Computer Science student at UFAL, with a strong interest in analysis and
  performance of algorithms, compilers and software architecture.
